# CS-631-Database-Management-and-System-Design

### PROJECT

Purpose of this project:
Analyze, design, implement, and document a database system application. We will use
the methodology for database development learned in class. The system must be
implemented on a DBMS with any language as a host-language for the application (use
of Java and accessing the database using JDBC is one possibility.)
